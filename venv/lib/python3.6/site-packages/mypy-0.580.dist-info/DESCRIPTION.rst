Mypy -- Optional Static Typing for Python
=========================================

Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type
check them.  Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it
can catch many programming errors by analyzing your program, without
actually having to run it.  Mypy has a powerful type system with
features such as type inference, gradual typing, generics and union
types.
